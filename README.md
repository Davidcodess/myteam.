## Overview

MyTeam is a fictional company website focused on finding the best talent for your organization with the best practices to drive your product or business.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- See the correct content for each team member on the About page when the `+` icon is clicked
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should display if a user doesn't include the proper enail format.

## My process

In this project my process was to build each page individually from top starting with the <header> and <nav> down through each <section> of the page and lastly to th ever bottom with the <footer>. While writing the structure I ensured to assign element with specific classes or id's with the styling in mind. Starting the homepage I styled everything based on the figma document provided. This file helped immensely by giving the widths of containers and specific colors for different elements throughout the site. By styling the homepage first it made the following pages much easier and I was able to reuse some CSS classes throughout the website. In this project I created it's desktop version first and scaled down to tablet version and then the mobile version using media queries. I didnt impliment jQuery until almost all styling was complete to ensure the website looked great and the functionality works as it should without effecting the user experience.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS and responsive design
- jQuery

### What I learned

This was my first larger project without instruction and it was a fun challange! I deepened my understanding of HTML by properly structuring the different sections of the website and using different semantic elements to improve accessibility. This included properly nesting elements, utalizing different elements such as <header>,<nav>,<section>,and <footer>.

Throughout this project I felt I was continously challanged with bringing the structure to life with CSS. I utilized custom styling primarialy by targeting specific classes and reusing them when possible.By utalizing a variety of CSS properties and some slight animations I quickly began to structure everything with ease. Additionally I focused prioritizing a responsive design to ensure the website looks great on different screen sizes for users. And I realized how styling would effect later development when scaled down to a smaller screen in both a positive and negative way.

This was my first project utalizing jQuery so it was a challange in the beginning. However, I was able to quickly understand the syntax and when necessary impliment it into my website's functionality. I leveraged jQuery's powerful selectors and event handling capabilities to create interactive features like the slideToggle used for the director's section and the hamburger menu on mobile screens.Through only used slightly throughout the project, where I used jQuery allowed for a more engaging user experience.

### Continued development

I plan on continuing to practice the fundamentals of front-end development. There are some things I feel extremely confident in and somethings I know I'm not strong in at this time. I want to practice css animations and begin learning css frameworks like Tailwind CSS to build to build a better user experience.I also want to deepening my understanding of Javascript's syntax to begin to build more interactive projects.
